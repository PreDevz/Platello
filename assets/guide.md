# Guide for Project

- Avoid Prompts, Alerts, and Confirms, instead try Modals
- Keep same fonts, design/style, and theme through all pages
- When you're done with your code, add, commit, then push your changes up to your remote branch (we won't ever be working on the main branch) THEN whenever you come back, make sure to PULL remote branch just in case there were changes by other team members

## Fonts

1. **Poppins** with Light 300, Regular 400, and Bold 700: "**@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@300;400;700&display=swap');**" && "**font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;**"

2. **Montserrat** with Light 300, Regular 400, and Bold 700: "**@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@300;400;700&display=swap');**" && "**font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;**"

_For header (h1, h2, h3.. etc) use **Poppins**_ <br>
_For other texts (p, span, button, textarea... etc) use **Montserrat**_
